# Portfolio Entry: Snack Tanger 303 Ecosystem

## 📋 Project Overview
**Client:** Snack Tanger 303 (Food Service)
**Role:** Full Stack Developer
**Context:** The client needed a dual solution: an internal tool to manage orders/kitchen (POS) and a high-performance digital menu for customers.

The solution consists of two distinct but integrated applications:
1.  **Core POS System:** A local-first application for order management, kitchen display, and administrative tasks.
2.  **Public Satellite Web:** A static, SEO-optimized digital menu synced automatically from the local system.

## 🛠️ System 1: The POS & Management Core (Internal)
This application acts as the central brain of the restaurant. It runs locally to ensure zero latency during high-traffic service hours.

### Key Features
*   **Touch-First Point of Sale:** Interface optimized for fast order entry (differentiating Dine-in vs Takeaway).
*   **Real-Time Kitchen Display:** Digital ticket system replacing traditional paper printers.
*   **Dynamic Admin Panel:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Products, Categories, and Variants.
*   **Automated Deployment Pipeline:** A custom "Publish" button that triggers a Python script to compile data, optimize images, and deploy updates to the public web.

### 💻 Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React (Vite):** Blazing fast SPA architecture.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework.
    *   **Methodology:** Mobile-First & Responsive Design principles.
    *   **Lucide React:** Modern icon library.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Python (FastAPI):** High-performance asynchronous API framework.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Production-grade relational database.
    *   **SQLModel (SQLAlchemy):** Type-safe ORM interactions.
*   **Infrastructure & DevOps:**
    *   **Docker:** Full containerization for consistent environments.
    *   **Linux / Bash Scripting:** Server administration and automation scripts.
    *   **Git & GitHub Actions:** CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Automation & Asset Management:**
    *   **Node.js & Sharp:** High-performance image processing pipeline.
    *   **NPM:** Package management and script orchestration.
*   **Development Acceleration (AI Tools):**
    *   **Antigravity & Gemini:** Utilized for advanced pair-programming, architectural validation, and rapid prototyping.

## 🌐 System 2: The Public Digital Menu (Satellite)
A lightweight, customer-facing web application designed for mobile access via QR codes.

### Key Features
*   **Performance First:** Zero blocking time. Images served in next-gen formats (`.webp`).
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Decoupled from the backend database for maximum security and speed.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Multi-language support (ES, EN, FR, AR, DE, NL).
*   **Smart UX:** Scroll-spy navigation and mobile-first responsive design.

### 💻 Tech Stack
*   **Frontend Core:**
    *   **React (Vite):** Optimized build for rapid loading.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** Modern utility-first styling.
    *   **Mobile-First Design:** Interface specifically crafted for smartphone usage (QR scan context).
*   **State & Data:**
    *   **React Context API:** Global state management for Shopping Cart and Language preferences.
    *   **Local Storage:** Client-side persistence for user settings.
    *   **JSON API:** Consumption of structured static data generated by the core system.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   **GitHub Pages:** Zero-cost, high-availability static hosting.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automatic build and deploy triggers on main branch push.

## 🚀 Key Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. The "Offline-to-Online" Sync Bridge
**Problem:** The restaurant changes prices locally in the POS, but the public web is hosted on GitHub Pages (static).
**Solution:** I engineered a Python pipeline (`publish_manager.py`) that:
1.  Queries the local SQLite database.
2.  Generates a sanitized `menu.json`.
3.  Optimizes all new images using a Node.js/Sharp subprocess.
4.  Commits and pushes the changes to the remote GitHub repository automatically.
*Result:* The client updates a price on their local tablet, clicks one button, and the world sees the update in 2 minutes.

### 2. High-Performance Image Optimization
**Problem:** High-res food photos were slowing down the mobile menu (`.jpg/png` > 2MB).
**Solution:** Implemented a recursive Node.js script that detects raw images, converts them to high-efficiency `.webp` format, and rewrites all source code references dynamically.
*Result:* Reduced page load size by ~85% and improved Lighthouse performance score.
